# hacker-rank-test-preparation
---------------------------------------------------
Thank you for considering Amazon for your next career. We know there are loads of great companies out there so we are super 
excited that you have decided to think about us.

As part of the interview process for Software Development Engineers here at Amazon we would like you to complete the following 
technical assignment.

Please liaise with your Recruiter or Agent if you have any questions

Hope the test goes well.

All the best

You have been invited to attend the challenge SCP London Screening. You can take this challenge any time. 
The duration of the challenge will be 75 mins from the time you start.
---------------------------------------------------

The test will be from Hacker Rank.
 
·         You will need to do some practice tests on the site first of all BEFORE taking the real one.  
          This is essential so you get used to the system and way of coding.
-There are no IDEs, script/text editors. This is the format of programming Amazon use for tests and interviews.
·         Speed of how quickly you complete the test also plays a part – although good, clean concise code is paramount.
·         I have attached Amazon Interview Prep – worth reading through the technical areas discussed
·         Attached – Crack the Code – Chapter 6 is useful here since the logic based questions form the basis of some of the questions. Other chapters also useful to give you an idea, but the practice tests are more useful if time is tight for preparation.
·         There are other sites you can practise on as well: http://www.topcoder.com/, http://www.codechef.com/
 
Also look at these videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aClxtDcdpsQ + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0B4mOtwX0
 
Best of luck!

from amazon description:

Algorithms
Your interview with Amazon will not be focused on rote memorization of algorithms; however, having a good
understanding of the most common algorithms will likely make solving some of the questions we ask a lot easier. Consider
reviewing traversals, divide and conquer, and any other common algorithms you feel might be worth brushing up on. For
example, it might be good to know how and when to use a breadth-first search versus a depth-first search, and what the
tradeoffs are. Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of
algorithms is more important than memorizing the specific details of any given algorithm.

Coding
Expect to be asked to write syntactically correct code—no pseudo code. If you feel a bit rusty coding without an IDE or
coding in a specific language, it’s probably a good idea to dust off the cobwebs and get comfortable coding with a pen and
paper. The most important thing a Software Development Engineer does at Amazon is write scalable, robust, and welltested code. These are the main criteria by which your code will be evaluated, so make sure that you check for edge cases
and validate that no bad input can slip through. A few missed commas or typos here and there aren’t that big of a deal, but
the goal is to write code that’s as close to production ready as possible. This is your chance to show off your coding ability

Object-Oriented Design
Good design is paramount to extensible, bug free, long-lived code. It’s possible to solve any given software problem in an
almost limitless number of ways, but when software needs to be extensible and maintainable, good software design is
critical to success. Using Object-oriented design best practices is one way to build lasting software. You should have a
working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns as well as know how to write software in an objectoriented way, with appropriate use of inheritance and aggregation. You probably won’t be asked to describe the details of
how specific design patterns work, but expect to have to defend your design choices.

Databases
Most of the software that we write is backed by a data store, somewhere. Many of the challenges we face arise when
figuring out how to most efficiently retrieve or store data for future use. Amazon has been at the forefront of the nonrelational
DB movement. We have made Amazon Web Services such as SimpleDB and DynamoDB available for the
developer community that let them easily leverage the benefits of non-relational databases. The more you know about how
relational and non-relational databases work and what tradeoffs exist between them, the better prepared you will be.
However, we don’t assume any particular level of expertise.

Distributed Computing
Systems at Amazon have to work under very strict tolerances at a high load. While we have some internal tools that help us
with scaling, it’s important to have an understanding of a few basic distributed computing concepts. Having an
understanding of topics such as service oriented architectures, map-reduce, distributed caching, load balancing, etc. could
help you formulate answers to some of the more complicated distributed architecture questions you might encounter.
Operating Systems
You won’t need to know how to build your own operating system from scratch, but you should be familiar with some OS
topics that can affect code performance, such as: memory management, processes, threads, synchronization, paging, and
multithreading.

Internet Topics
You’re interviewing at Amazon. We do a lot of business online, and we expect our engineers to be familiar with at least the
basics of how the internet works. You might want to brush up on how browsers work at a high level, from DNS lookups and
TCP/IP, to socket connections. We aren’t looking for network engineer qualifications, but a solid understanding of the
fundamentals of how the web works is a requirement.
